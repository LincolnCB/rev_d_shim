# Building Snickerdoodle kernel

The full kernel build needs UBoot to be built first, but UBoot requires some scripts built from the kernel source.  So, the build process is a bit convoluted.


To first build the scripts of the kernel:
```bash
./build-kernel.sh -s
```

Next, to build UBoot:
```bash
./build-uboot -r
```

Finally, to build the kernel:
```bash
./build-kernel.sh -r
```
This requires sudo permissions to properly build the filesystem.

To clean the directories, run:
```bash
./build-kernel.sh -c
./build-uboot -c
```
