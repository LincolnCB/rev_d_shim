# Hardware Shutdown Sense Core

The `shim_shutdown_sense` module monitors the onboard shutdown mux and latches a high value if a shutdown is detected on any enabled channel.

## Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:**
  - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronous operation.
  - `shutdown_sense_connected [7:0]`: Indicates which shutdown sense channels are connected (active).
  - `shutdown_sense_en`: Enable signal to activate the shutdown sense functionality.
  - `shutdown_sense_pin`: Input signal indicating a shutdown condition.

- **Outputs:**
  - `shutdown_sense_sel [2:0]`: Selects which bit of the `shutdown_sense` register to update (cycles through 0â€“7).
  - `shutdown_sense [7:0]`: Stores the latched shutdown states for each channel.

## Operation

- When `shutdown_sense_en` is low, the module resets: `shutdown_sense_sel` is set to `000` and `shutdown_sense` is cleared to `0`.
- When enabled, on each rising edge of `clk`, `shutdown_sense_sel` increments, cycling through all 8 channels.
- For each selected channel, if `shutdown_sense_pin` is high **and** the corresponding bit in `shutdown_sense_connected` is set, the respective bit in `shutdown_sense` is latched high (`1`).
- Only channels marked as connected in `shutdown_sense_connected` will be detected and latched.
