# Trigger Core (`shim_trigger_core`)

The `shim_trigger_core` module provides flexible trigger management for the Rev D shim firmware..

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

- `clk`, `resetn`: Main clock and active-low reset.
- `cmd_word [31:0]`: Command word from buffer.
- `cmd_buf_empty`: Indicates if command buffer is empty.
- `ext_trig`: External trigger signal.
- `dac_waiting_for_trig [7:0]`: DAC channels waiting for trigger.
- `adc_waiting_for_trig [7:0]`: ADC channels waiting for trigger.
- `data_buf_full`, `data_buf_almost_full`: Data buffer status.

### Outputs

- `cmd_word_rd_en`: Enables reading the next command word.
- `trig_out`: Trigger pulse output.
- `data_word_wr_en`: Enables writing trigger timing data.
- `data_word [31:0]`: Trigger timing data (lower/upper 32 bits).
- `data_buf_overflow`, `bad_cmd`: Error flags.

## Operation

### Command Types

- **SYNC_CH (`3'd1`):** Synchronize trigger across all DAC/ADC channels.
- **SET_LOCKOUT (`3'd2`):** Set minimum lockout time between triggers.
- **EXPECT_EXT_TRIG (`3'd3`):** Wait for a specified number of external triggers.
- **DELAY (`3'd4`):** Wait for a specified delay (in clock cycles).
- **FORCE_TRIG (`3'd5`):** Force a trigger immediately.
- **CANCEL (`3'd7`):** Cancel current wait or operation.

### Command Word Structure

- `[31:29]` - Command code (3 bits).
- `[28]` - Trigger logging enable (1 bit): When set to `1`, triggers generated by this command will be logged to the data buffer with timing information.
- `[27:0]` - Command value (28 bits).

#### SYNC_CH Command (`3'd1`)

No additional parameters in the 28-bit command value field. Sends an internal trigger pulse to all DAC/ADC channels to synchronize them once they are all ready (waiting for trigger). When the trigger logging bit is set, the sync trigger will be logged to the data buffer with timing information.

#### SET_LOCKOUT Command (`3'd2`)

Sets the minimum lockout time between external triggers (ignore external triggers during this period) to the 28-bit value specified in the command word (in SPI clock cycles). The trigger logging bit is ignored for this command.

#### EXPECT_EXT_TRIG Command (`3'd3`)

Expect a specified number of external triggers before moving to the next command. The 28-bit command value specifies how many triggers to expect. If set to zero, the core will not wait for external triggers and will immediately return to IDLE state. When the trigger logging bit is set, each external trigger will be logged to the data buffer with timing information.

#### DELAY Command (`3'd4`)

Wait for a specified delay (in SPI clock cycles) before moving to the next command. The 28-bit command value specifies the delay duration. If set to zero, the core will not wait and will immediately return to IDLE state. The trigger logging bit is ignored for this command.

#### FORCE_TRIG Command (`3'd5`)

Forces an internal trigger pulse. This command does not wait for the DAC/ADC channels to be ready and can cause an unexpected trigger error. When the trigger logging bit is set, the forced trigger will be logged to the data buffer with timing information.

#### CANCEL Command (`3'd7`)

Cancels the current wait or operation. If the core is waiting for a trigger or delay, it will immediately exit that state and return to IDLE. It is recommended to clear the command buffer before issuing a CANCEL command to ensure immediate cancellation.

### Trigger Timing Data

- When trigger logging is enabled (bit 28 set), two 32-bit words are written to the data buffer for each trigger:
  - First word: Lower 32 bits of the trigger timer.
  - Second word: Upper 32 bits of the trigger timer.
- The 64-bit trigger timer starts counting from 1 on the first logged trigger and increments each clock cycle.
- Trigger logging only occurs for commands that have the logging bit set and actually generate triggers.

### State Machine

- **IDLE:** Awaiting commands.
- **SYNC_CH:** Synchronize channels before triggering.
- **EXPECT_TRIG:** Wait for external triggers.
- **DELAY:** Wait for delay or lockout period.
- **ERROR:** Error state.

### Error Handling

- Invalid commands set `bad_cmd`.
- Data buffer overflow sets `data_buf_overflow`.
- Lockout values below minimum are rejected.

## Notes

- Trigger lockout prevents triggers from occurring too rapidly.
- Synchronization ensures all DAC/ADC channels are ready before triggering.
- Timing data enables precise event timestamping for downstream processing.
