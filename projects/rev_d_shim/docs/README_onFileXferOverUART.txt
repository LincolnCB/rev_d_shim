There is a Linux library called lrzsz. It needs to be in the rootfs_config when petalinux-build is run. Package lrzsz contains two programs: rz and sz. Program rz receives a file from the host (h) and saves it on Petalinux (p) file system, whereas sz sends a file from Petalinux to the host, which saves it on the host file system. Think of it like this: rz=h2p and sz=p2h. Most mainstream terminal emulators over UART, such as minicom and picocom, have the capability to talk to rz and sz (through Zmodem protocol optionally Xmodem or Ymodem). I tried files as large as 100kB in both directions with success. At a baud rate of 115kbps, we get a net file xfer rate of around 92kbps. On picocom, for rz, we type rz at Petalinux prompt, then Ctrl-a Ctrl-s (s for send) and enter the file name when asked. For sz, we type sz <name of file to send from Petalinux>, then Ctrl-a Ctrl-r (r for receive). It asks for file name again. Just press Enter. If you enter a file name at that point, sz locks up for a while then terminates without success.
