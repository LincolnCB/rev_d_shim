# Cores

This directory contains custom IP cores for use in Vivado's block design build flow. These cores are used in the projects in the `projects/` directory. Cores are separated by "vendor", which is the name of the person or organization that created the core (this is partially to handle licensing differences between cores, which are all open-source but variably restrictive in terms of GNU vs MIT).
